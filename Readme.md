# Tic Tac Toe Project

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive web interface.
- Two-player mode for friendly competitions.
- Error handling to prevent invalid moves.
- Modular code structure for easy understanding and future enhancements.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Tic Tac Toe game in your web browser:

1. Clone the repository to your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

   ```bash
   # For example, on Linux/macOS:
   open index.html

   # On Windows:
   start index.html
   ```

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid on the web page.
2. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marks (X or O).
3. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.
